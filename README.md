# MI-Detection-using-Entropy-Features
A supervised learning project for classifying myocardial infarction from PPG data using entropy features such as Permutation Entropy (PE), Dispersion Entropy (DE), and their reverse counterparts. Includes feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and SHAP-based interpretability.

This project aims to detect Myocardial Infarction (MI) using entropy-based features extracted from Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. By computing Permutation Entropy (PE), Dispersion Entropy (DE), and their reverse counterparts (RPE and RDE), we capture the underlying complexity and variability in PPG signals that are indicative of abnormal cardiac activity. A dataset containing 187 samples, each with 2000 PPG data points and labeled as either 'Normal' or 'MI', was used for training and evaluation.

Multiple machine learning models—Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and KNN—were trained using Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. The model achieved an impressive accuracy of 96.14% on the original test set and 94.02% on a noisy version of the test set, with only a 2.12% drop in performance, showcasing the model’s robustness under real-world signal disturbances. Evaluation metrics such as ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score were used for performance assessment. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) was applied for feature interpretability to understand the contribution of each entropy feature to the final prediction.

This model is lightweight and highly accurate, making it suitable for deployment in wearable health monitoring devices like smartwatches for real-time heart anomaly detection. Future extensions include expanding the dataset for multi-class classification (e.g., Ventricular Tachycardia, Heart Block), live signal integration, and deployment on mobile platforms for continuous health monitoring.
